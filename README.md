### Web-Based Attendance Recording System  

I recently designed and developed a **Web-Based Attendance Recording System** to efficiently track employee attendance with a user-friendly interface and automated calculations. This system streamlines the process of recording, searching, and managing attendance data while ensuring accuracy and ease of use.  

#### **Key Features:**  
✅ **Attendance Recording:** Allows users to log attendance entries with details such as employee name, department, and date. Prevents duplicate entries.  
✅ **Search & Filtering:** Enables searching attendance records by day, month, or year, with a 'from-to' date range for flexible queries.  
✅ **Payment Type Management:** Supports multiple payment types, including **‘ውሎ አበል’** (daily wage) and **‘በደሞዝ እስኬል’** (salary-based).  
✅ **Total Present Days Calculation:** Automatically calculates and displays the number of days an employee has attended.  
✅ **Editable Records:** Users can update attendance details, including date, month, and year, ensuring data consistency.  
✅ **Reason Field:** Allows users to document the purpose of attendance for better record-keeping.  
✅ **Report Generation & Print Option:** Displays all attendance records on the index page and includes a print feature for generating reports.  

This project was developed using **Python, Django, SQLite, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, ensuring a responsive and interactive web application. It enhances efficiency by automating attendance tracking and simplifying data management.  

Would you like me to adjust the wording to match a specific tone or format for your portfolio? 😊
